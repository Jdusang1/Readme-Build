For this project we were to build out a command line application that would help a user build out a professional readme.md for their intended project. We were to use the "Inquirer" extension to prompt users through a series of questions regarding their project. Those answers were then stored and dynamically populated to a read me file. The readme file was to also to include git hub mark down. The use of one badge was desired as well. I was able to link the badge to the readme through the users selection of license choice. The readme that is generated by the application is entitled generatedReadMe.md.
